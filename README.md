# FaceRecognition_Project
This project contains the code for an end-to-end face recognition model which will generate training data using webcam and then build a classifier to recognize different faces

## Prerequisites
This project requires Python 3 and the NumPy and OpenCV libraries


## Installation
Use the below command to install the required libraries

````python -m pip install opencv-python````

````python -m pip install numpy````

## Methodology
This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) ML  Allgorithm to recognize faces.

## Usage
* First run the **face_data_collect.py** file to store your face data.
* Then run the **face_recognition.py** to run the face recognition algorithm.
* Press **q** on the keyboard to exit quit the video capture window.
